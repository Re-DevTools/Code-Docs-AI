Docs AI is a Visual Studio Code extension that leverages the power of GPT-4 to generate code comments for your Python code. It helps you understand your code better by providing insightful and contextually accurate comments.

## Features

- __Automatic Comment Generation__: Simply highlight the code block you want comments for, right-click and select 'Generate Comment with Docs AI'. Docs AI will analyze your code and generate a comment that helps explaining what the code does.

- __GPT-4 Powered__: Docs AI uses the GPT-4 model from OpenAI, which is known for its ability to understand context and generate human-like text. This ensures that the comments generated are accurate and helpful.
